Need to add security to api_endpoints so that only you can check it , maybe add some kind of passcode or token , that is for each users.  
Also need to think about security , can't access other databases. 
Also need to think about hosting it somewhere. 
Better error handling.

Create social media app with lots of users and transactions, use distributed systems ,to gain an understanding . 


Things to do:
Add dashboard
Ability to delete stuff:
 When creating projects-need to delete databases as well. 
If error creating username send that .
When create project , refresh to render project. - Done
When creating database , refresh to render project.- Done. 
Wehn creating tables , need to delete.-Done
Need to add foreign keys , add option to write sql query to create table. 


Security:

Send api authenticaiton.

Need to do a lot of stuff. 
Make sure others cant access your database. Key in db.
When they are sending api response , don't allow them to send api repsonse.
SQL Injection .

One last thing:
iF A database  EXISTS when creating one ,  don't add it to the user transaction problem.
Have an api_page. 



    toDO:
    WHEN A NEW API IS ADDED , REFresh : IF I REFRESH WILL THE JIT TOKEN BE DIFFERENT?
