Need to add security to api_endpoints so that only you can check it , maybe add some kind of passcode or token , that is for each users.  
Also need to think about security , can't access other databases. 
Also need to think about hosting it somewhere. 
Better error handling.

Create social media app with lots of users and transactions, use distributed systems ,to gain an understanding . 


Things to do:
Add dashboard
Ability to delete stuff
If error creating username send that .
When create prokect , refresh to render project
When creating database , refresh to render project. 
Need to add foreign keys , add option to write sql query to create table. 


Security:
Need to do a lot of stuff. 
Make sure others cant access your database. Key in db.
When they are sending api response , don't allow them to send api repsonse.
SQL Injection .
